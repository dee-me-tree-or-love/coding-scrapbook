# Study Filter

This Jupyter notebook allows to filter a list of exported citations based on
a custom-defined selection criteria with multiple authors.

Although this implementation offers a very basic setup, it may be useful during
the literature review or a mapping study.

## Getting around

- [`Makefile`](./Makefile) - defines the commands for running the Jupyter notebooks using Docker.
- [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile) - defines the image for the jupyter notebook.
